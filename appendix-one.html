            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                <p>Much of the benefit from a defined database schema depends on use of clearly defined vocabularies. On the basis of many discussions within the geoscience community over the past three decades, it seems to be the consensus (and a logical conclusion) that users of geologic map databases are best served if certain terminology, particularly for lithology, is consistent from one database to another. Such a list of terms commonly is referred to as a controlled-term list or a vocabulary.</p>	
				<p>The terms that populate the GeoMaterial and GeoMaterialConfidence fields in the <a href="required.html#descriptionOfMapUnits">DescriptionOfMapUnits</a> table constitute such a controlled-term list. These terms are defined below, and they are encapsulated in a database table (see <a href="required.html#table17">table 17</a>) generated by the script <em>GeMS_CreateDatabase_Arc10.py</em> (or its replacement), available at the GeMS Toolkit site on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/usgs/GeMS_Tools" target="_blank">https://github.com/usgs/GeMS_Tools</a> or <a href="https://github.com/usgs/gems-tools-pro" target="_blank">https://github.com/usgs/gems-tools-pro</a>). The table is also available as an <a href="files/GeoMaterials.xlsx">Excel spreadsheet</a> under the Resources heading at the GeMS website (<a href="https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/" target="_blank">https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/</a>); the spreadsheet also includes the field HierarchyKey to facilitate sorting.</p>

            <h2 id="scopeandintent">Scope and Intent</h2>
                <p>This classification of materials is intended to characterize a map unit by means of a generalized category (GeoMaterial) based on lithologic and genetic criteria; it applies to the map unit as a whole. The purposes of this classification are to provide a basis for quickly integrating map data from different sources and to convey to the public a simple, general sense of each map unit’s lithology and genesis. We recognize that such a classification cannot completely address the immense variety of map units present across the Nation, and we expect that other regionally specific classifications of map units will be developed that are more appropriate to local conditions. The appropriateness of a selected GeoMaterial term for describing a map unit is specified by values in the GeoMaterialConfidence field (see table 1–1), which provide the map user with a potentially useful qualifier term (please refer to the <a href="content.html#classification">Geologic Materials</a> discussion in the “<a href="background.html#design">Design Considerations</a>” section, above).</p>

                <p>The lithologic terms in the GeoMaterial field and their definitions are provided below, and their hierarchy is represented by an indented format for clarity. Documentation of this classification, including rationale for its development, was provided in Soller (2009); some terms and definitions in that classification were updated for version 1.1 of GeneralLithology (see “Archive of Previous Versions and Related Information” section at <a href="https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/" target="_blank">https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/</a>). In the nine years of test implementation among the state geological surveys and USGS, this classification was slightly modified for GeMS, and renamed as “GeoMaterial”. The current version of this classification is maintained at the GeMS website.</p>

Composed of light-colored rocks (for example, rhyolite, dacite, trachyte, latite).</li>
													<li><strong>Intermediate-composition air-fall tephra</strong> &mdash; Fragments of volcanic rock and lava, of various sizes, carried into the air by explosions and by hot gases in eruption columns or lava fountains; known as tephra.

										<li><strong>Lava flows</strong> &mdash; Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, solidified bodies of rock that form when they cool.

Includes basaltic shield volcanoes, which may become very large (for example, Hawaii).</li>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Felsic-composition lava flows</strong> &mdash; Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, solidified bodies of rock that form when they cool. Because of their high silica content and resulting high viscosity, parental magmas tend to erupt explosively, and so these deposits are uncommon. Includes fine-grained, lightcolored rock with rhyolitic, dacitic, trachytic, and latitic composition.</li>
												<li><strong>Intermediate-composition lava flows</strong> &mdash; Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, solidified bodies of rock that form when they cool.

											</ul>
										<li><strong>Volcanic mass flow</strong> &mdash; Volcanic deposits formed by mass movement (for example, debris avalanches, debris flows, lahar deposits), in many cases triggered by volcanic eruption. Debris avalanches that occur on volcanoes clearly without eruptive trigger may be classified as sedimentary (for example, as “Debris flows, landslides, and other localized mass-movement sediment”).</li>
