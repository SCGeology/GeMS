						<p>Some units use specialized symbols in their map-unit labels; however, the special characters needed to render such symbols on a map are less intelligible to readers of the MapUnit field (see examples in <a href="database-design.html#table-11">table 11</a>). Thus, the MapUnit value is not used to label the unit on the map; instead, the Label field is. The Label field accommodates the use of special characters (for example, to display geologic age symbols using the FGDCGeoAge font; see <a href="database-design.html#table-11">table 11</a>). The MapUnit field generally contains an easily understood ASCII-character equivalent of the specialized symbol. When no specialized symbol is needed, Label and MapUnit typically have the same value (see <a href="database-design.html#table-11">table 11</a>). For more information on geologic age symbols, see Section 32 in the FGDC cartographic standard (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/11A02/" target="_blank">FGDC, 2006</a>).</p>
						<p>Note that areas of open water (for example, lakes, wide rivers), glaciers, snowfields, and unmapped areas must be included in MapUnitPolys, and they must have non-null MapUnit values (examples would be MapUnit = “water”, “glacier”, “unmapped”); however, such areas commonly are not labeled with their MapUnit values (therefore, Label = &lt;null&gt;).</p>
							<h4 class="h5">Topology Rules</h4>

								<ul>
									<li>Polygons must not overlap.</li>

						<p>Map boundaries, open-water boundaries, and snowfield and glacier boundaries delineate the edge of certain map-unit polygons. In this sense, they are contacts, and, therefore, they are included in this feature class.</p>
						<p>Scratch boundaries (also known as wash boundaries) are boundaries for which no symbol is drawn. We recommend setting the value of Symbol = “blank” for scratch boundaries.</p>
						<p>Examples of values suggested for the Type field include the following:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
								<li>“contact”</li>
								<li>“contact, internal”</li>
								<li>“contact, gradational”</li>
								<li>“contact, unconformable”</li>
								<li>“fault”</li>
								<li>“fault, normal”</li>
								<li>“fault, reverse”</li>
								<li>“fault, thrust”</li>
								<li>“scratch boundary”</li>
								<li>“glacier boundary”</li>
								<li>“waterline”</li>
								<li>“shoreline”</li>
								<li>“map boundary”, “map neatline”, or “neatline”</li>
							</ul>
						<p>The above list is derived from Sections 1, 2, 30, and 31 in the appendix of the FGDC cartographic standard (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/11A02/" target="_blank">FGDC, 2006</a>). Other values of Type certainly are acceptable (for example, see the CGI FaultType and ContactType vocabularies, available at <A href="http://resource.geosciml.org/def/voc/" target="_blank">http://resource.geosciml.org/def/voc/</a>).</p>
						<p>It has been a common practice to encode (via symbolization on a paper map, or a single attribute field in a database) contacts as, for example, “contact, certain”, “contact, inferred”, “contact, approximately located”, “contact, concealed”, “contact, queried”, or some permutation of these values. In the GeMS schema, these line features all would have the same value of Type (“contact”) but different values of IsConcealed, LocationConfidenceMeters, ExistenceConfidence, and (or) IdentityConfidence. Faults and some other line features that have been encoded in a similar fashion are treated the same way in the GeMS schema. Although this is a departure from what may have been a common practice, it allows for map data that is more easily communicated to nonspecialists, is more intelligently combined with other data, and is better used at other scales. See discussion in the “<a href="content.html#metadata">Feature-Level Metadata</a>” section above.</p>
						<p>Note that not all lines in ContactsAndFaults necessarily bound polygons. In some cases, polygons separated by concealed faults or concealed contacts may have been merged during construction of the database; also, some faults and concealed contacts may dangle (that is, terminate within a polygon) and, thus, may not always separate polygons.</p>
							<h4 class="h5">Topology Rules</h4>
								<p>The following topology rules apply to the ContactsAndFaults line feature class:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Lines must not overlap each other.</li>
										<li>Lines must not overlap themselves.</li>
										<li>Lines must not intersect themselves.</li>
										<li>Except for faults and concealed contacts, lines must not have dangles; therefore, dangling lines must have values of either (1) Type = “fault” (or some variant thereof) or (2) Type = “contact” or “fault” and IsConcealed = “Y”.</li>

				<p>Note that the authoritative source for the content of a DescriptionOfMapUnits table should always be a DMU (not a List of Map Units, or LMU), whether the DMU appears on the map sheet or is included in an accompanying pamphlet. An LMU on a map sheet is only a distillation of the full content of the DMU and is provided as a convenience to help identify units on the map.</p>
				<p>A DMU is strongly formatted and typically hierarchical, in many cases following the guidelines and conventions specified in USGS’s “Suggestions to Authors of the Reports of the United States Geological Survey, Eighth Edition” (STA8) (USGS, in press; see also, STA7, Hansen, 1991, p. 49–52); see discussion in the “Notes on the Content of the Description Field” section below. The DescriptionOfMapUnits table encodes the DMU as is specified in STA8, without loss of information and—with two exceptions (the two GeoMaterial fields)—without imposing additional structure or content.</p> 
				<p id="geomaterialFields">We have added the fields GeoMaterial and GeoMaterialConfidence to the DescriptionOfMapUnits table in order to provide abbreviated content that will allow for simple queries and (or) generalized symbolizations of the character of geologic map units across one or many maps. It is important that users populate the GeoMaterial field with terms from the NGMDB standard term list (included in <a href="appendix-one.html">appendix 1</a>); they should then use the GeoMaterialConfidence field to characterize the relative appropriateness of the term chosen for the GeoMaterial field. Note that the abbreviated content in the GeoMaterial field is not a replacement for the full, robust, free-text information in the Description field. Note also that additional, more detailed lithologic information may be included either in a supplementary user-defined table or in the optional StandardLithology table (see discussion in appendix 2, “<a href="appendix-two.html#standardLith">Optional Elements</a>”).</p>
					<h3 class="h4">Notes on the Content of the Description Field</h3>
						<p>The content of the Description field in the DescriptionOfMapUnits table is an essential part of this database schema, just as the map-unit descriptions in a DMU are always an essential part of a geologic map report. This schema does not prescribe a particular form or content of such descriptions; however, we support the ideas put forth in STA8 (USGS, in press), which states the following:</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">“Description of Map Units”, &ast;&ast;&ast;<sup>[<span class="footnote" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#thirteen">13</span>]</sup>  for each map unit, contains its map-unit label, its name, and its assigned age system, followed by an abbreviated account of the lithologic characteristics of its rocks and (or) deposits &ast;&ast;&ast; described in order of increasing age; thus, surficial units are described before bedrock units. The ranking of units and subunits on a geologic map is indicated in the DMU by successive levels of indentation of the unit descriptions &ast;&ast;&ast;, as the following examples show:</p> 
						<p style="padding-left: 108px; text-indent: -36px;"><strong>Dakota Group (Cretaceous)</strong>—Alternating sandstone and dark-colored shale beds overlying beds of sandstone, conglomerate, and claystone</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 108px; text-indent: -36px;"><strong>South Platte Formation (Lower Cretaceous)</strong>—Alternating beds of gray to black shale and brown-weathering sandstone</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 108px; text-indent: -36px;"><strong>Kassler Sandstone Member</strong>—Brown-weathering, massive, fine-grained sandstone</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">Headings are used to organize and identify groups of units. Beneath each heading, each map unit is described in order of increasing age; thus, the upper member of a formation would be described before its middle or lower members. The hierarchy of a DMU heading is indicated by a unique type style; &ast;&ast;&ast; the DMU title (“Description of Map Units”) is [considered a] first-order heading. A typical DMU contains at least two second-order headings (for example, “Surficial Deposits” and “Bedrock”), although most DMUs commonly contain a few third- and fourth-order headings as well (for example, “Volcanic Rocks” and “Pyroclastic Deposits”); some maps may require as many as seven orders of headings.</p>
						<p>STA8 (USGS, in press) also notes the long tradition of writing the DMU and makes suggestions for its content, some of which may be useful to transcribe here: </p>
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">[A] unit description always includes the following three fundamental elements: (1) the map-unit label (for example, Tml), (2) the name of the unit (for example, Monterey Formation), and (3) the unit’s age or stratigraphic position, listed from youngest to oldest (for example, Pliocene and Miocene). These elements are followed by the unit description, which contains information such as lithologic content, color, grain size, bedding characteristics, porosity, permeability, fracture characteristics, mineral or fossil content, remanent magnetization, and thickness. Correlation with other units, the nature of a unit’s upper and lower contacts, any radiometric or other types of age determinations, the sources of specific information, and, if applicable, more detailed stratigraphic ages &ast;&ast;&ast; also may be provided. Stratigraphic or lithologic details are limited to data from within the map area, although a brief discussion of correlations with rock units in nearby areas may be appropriate. Reference citations to other published works also may be included.</p> 
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">Map-unit descriptions in a DMU typically are written in an abbreviated, telegraphic style in which complete sentences are not necessary. Nonessential articles (“a,” “an,” “the”) usually are omitted. A notable exception is that the article “the” is retained before a map-unit name. In many DMU sentences, the word “unit” (in singular form) is the implicit subject and commonly is omitted; however, retaining the word “unit” is recommended for clarity (rather than using a unit symbol) when referring to a unit within its own description. Sentences may also begin with a specific subject, such as “Deposits,” “Beds,” or “Flows,” if desired.</p> 
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">The order of describing lithology may differ from map to map, but it should be consistent within a given DMU. Features such as color, permeability, and gradations in grain size usually modify the lithologic term. Commas are used to separate all strings of descriptive terms except the final one before the lithologic term, as the following example shows:</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 108px; text-indent: -36px;"><strong>Curtis Formation (Jurassic)</strong>—Consists of interbedded light-gray, fine- to coarse-grained, poorly sorted, thickly bedded sandstone, pale-green shale, and pale-blue limestone</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">To separate ideas within a description, periods or semicolons may work better than conjunctions. Lengthy unit descriptions may be divided into paragraphs. Periods are omitted at the end of each description, except when it is split into paragraphs (in such cases, a period is included at the end of every paragraph except the last one). If entries are fairly short and no one lithology predominates, normal word order (for example, “pale-green shale and pale-blue limestone”) may read more smoothly than inverted order, but if an entry is long and has a string of modifiers, an inverted sentence structure may be easier to follow:</p>
					<p style="padding-left: 108px; text-indent: -36px;"><strong>Curtis Formation (Jurassic)</strong>—Interbedded sandstone, shale, and limestone. Sandstone, light-gray, fine- to coarse-grained, poorly sorted, and thickly bedded. Shale, pale-green to gray and fine- to medium-bedded. Limestone, pale-blue to light-gray, fine-grained, and medium-bedded</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 36px;">Other information that characterizes the entire unit (for example, magnetization, fossil or mineral content, radiometric age, and so on) usually follows. The order in which such features are listed may depend on their significance in the mind of the author, but the style should be consistent throughout the description.</p>
						<p>Although not specifically prescribed in STA8 (USGS, in press), we submit that listing DMU elements in a consistent manner facilitates map comprehension. To that end, we offer R.E. Wells’ (USGS, written commun., 2010) suggestion to use the following basic order for listing elements in map-unit descriptions in a DMU: lithology (dominant and subordinate); color; induration; grain size; mineralogy; bedding characteristics; interpreted facies; unit thickness; nature of contacts; fossil content/stage/zone; magnetic polarity; correlation with other units; radiometric age; and data sources where needed.</p>
						<p>We note that not all map units in a DMU need all of these descriptive elements; also, volcanic rocks, plutonic rocks, metamorphic rocks, and surficial deposits require somewhat different approaches. Nevertheless, the main elements as articulated by Wells are relevant for most map units. We further note that map-unit descriptions in a DMU should emphasize the essential character of each unit and how it is distinguished in the field from nearby units. In poorly exposed terrain, it can be a challenge to write a map-unit description that accurately expresses no more than what little can be seen or is known about a map unit.</p>
					<h3 class="h4">Populating the DescriptionOfMapUnits Table</h3>
						<p>All map units (including units in cross sections) in the DMU need an entry in the DescriptionOfMapUnits table. Any map units shown as overlays need entries as well. Entries should also include map units that traditionally are not listed in the DMU, such as “water”, “glacier”, or “unmapped area”, as well as all geologic units that are listed as parent units in the DMU but are not represented as polygons on the map or in the cross sections.</p> 			
						<p>Headings and headnotes in the DMU also need entries in the DescriptionOfMapUnits table: headings are stored in the Name field, and headnotes are stored in the Description field. An example of the translation of part of a DMU into a DescriptionOfMapUnits table is provided in <a href="appendix-three.html">appendix 3</a>.</p>
						<p>The DescriptionSourceID field commonly points to Source values = “this report” or “modified from <em>&lt;earlier report&gt;”</em>.</p>
					<h3 class="h4">Order and Rank of Map Units</h3>
						<p>The order and rank of map units and headings in a DMU carry a significant amount of information. In the printed DMU, order is explicit and rank is expressed by font and paragraph style. In the DescriptionOfMapUnits table, where order is easily lost by sorting and text is unformatted, order and rank are expressed by values in the HierarchyKey field. Examples of the content of the HierarchyKey field and its construction are provided in <a href="appendix-three.html">appendix 3</a>.</p>
						<p>We wish to enable generation of the formatted text DMU from the DescriptionOfMapUnits table, both to facilitate report production and to test that the database is capturing essential content in the report. In most cases, font and paragraph style in the printed DMU can be calculated from values in HierarchyKey and MapUnit (the latter to test whether a DescriptionOfMapUnits row corresponds to a mapped unit or is a heading). However, we have found that (1) such automated text generation requires links to the appropriate parts of a document template, and (2) additional information is needed to distinguish use of a group or formation as a heading from its use as an unmapped parent unit (that is, only its subunits have been mapped). The ParagraphStyle field is included to meet these needs (see <a href="#table-14">table 14</a> for an example of values). In most—but not all—cases, ParagraphStyle values can be calculated from values of HierarchyKey and MapUnit. The consequent partial redundancy between HierarchyKey and ParagraphStyle fields allows for some automated checking of the DescriptionOfMapUnits table for logical consistency.</p>
						<p>As a practical matter, values in the ParagraphStyle field and their corresponding definitions in the Glossary table should correspond to the formatting styles prescribed by an organization’s publication standards and guidelines. If templates for these styles are available, they may be incorporated into a script that automates much—if not all—of the construction of a formatted DMU from the DescriptionOfMapUnits table.</p>

				<p>All features and table entries must be associated with a data source. For maps that contain all new information and use a single vocabulary source, the DataSources table will be very short. For compilations that contain data from many sources that have been modified and (or) reinterpreted so that the data source has effectively been changed, the DataSources table will become longer and quite useful. It is worth noting that GeMS does not prescribe the level of detail or depth of provenance that is contained in the DataSources table. We recognize that the amount or level of source lineage recorded on a feature-level basis often is a function of the time and resources available, and so it is a decision that needs to be made by the mapper or compiler and the publishing agency. Some may choose to only cite either publication references or “this report”; others may cite only the original report in which the data first appeared; still others may record the person compiling the map and the year as the data source because they may have a tool that easily captures this data. All are acceptable in the GeMS schema, although their actual usefulness may vary.</p>
